Assignment 2
1. Use the packet analyzing tool tcpdump to capture an ICMP destination unreachable
message from one of the four networks 172.x.0.0/16 and show the captured message.
2. Use the packet analyzing tool tcpdump to capture an ICMP redirect message from
one of the four networks 172.x.0.0/16; show the captured ICMP redirect messages;
and show the changes of the routing cache and the routing paths caused by the ICMP
redirect message.
3. Select a pair of hosts A and B, one in network net17 and one in network net18. Use
tracepath6 on A to test the reachability of B. Use the packet analyzing tool tcpdump
to capture an IPv6 datagram in net17, net18 or net19 which carries the data from
your tracepath6 request, and capture an IPv4 datagram in net16 which carries an
IPv6 datagram for the tracepath6. Show the captured datagrams


Assignment 4:
Design an encryption scheme for a secure TCP connection using the above framework with
N = 5, r, n = 4 and m = 40 characters, including at least the 26 letters, numbers 0 ~ 9,
a symbol for space, and punctuation marks of comma, full stop and question mark. Write
programs (in JAVA or C++, please get the approval from your TA if other languages are
used) which realize a secure communication by TCP between a client and a server using
your encryption scheme.
