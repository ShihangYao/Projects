Assignment 1:

Some coding practises to write helper functions in Go. For example:

1.) Implement a function called countPrimes(n) that returns the number of primes less than, or equal to, the int n. For example, countPrimes(5) should return 3, countPrimes(10000) should return 1229,and countPrimes(-6) should return 0.
2.) Implement a function called countStrings(filename) that reads the contents of the file named filename, and returns a map[string]int whose keys are all the different strings in the file, and the corresponding values are the number of times the key occurs in the file

Etc.


Assignment 2:

Write a Go program that takes any valid JSON as input (from standard input) and outputs (to standard output) HTML that transform the JSON as follows:
• all tokens are consistently colored in a pleasing way
• the formatting is neat and consistent


Assignment 3:

Some coding practises to write helper functions in Haskell. For example:

1.) Write a function called count_emirps n that returns the number of emirps less than, or equal to, n.

2.)  Implement invert :: [Bit] -> [Bit], which flips all the bits in the input list.

Etc.

Assignment 4:

Repeat assignment 2, this time using Haskell.
